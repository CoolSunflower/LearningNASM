x86 is a 32 bit processor, each register is 32 bits in size

Example Registers: EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX
16 Bit Registers: AX, BX, CX, DX
8 bit High: AH, BH, CH, DH
8 bit Low: AL, BL, CL, DL

See regs1.png, regs2.png for some common registers in x86


NOTE: run the following command:
echo "set disassembly-flavor intel" > ~/.gdbinit

This sets the format of layout asm to intel instead of at&t
